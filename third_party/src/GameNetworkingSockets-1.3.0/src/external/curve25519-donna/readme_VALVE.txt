curve25519-donna is an implementation of the Curve25519 ECDH key-exchange algorithm by Dan J Bernstein.

curve25519 is a "256-bit strength" elliptical curve (equivalent to NIST P-256) with 32-byte secret/public keys.

It is very fast, easy to implement securely in software, and fully public-domain.
